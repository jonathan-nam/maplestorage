 * CORS, which Better Auth does not do for us and which nothing here needed until now.
 *
 * The documented setup puts these routes inside the Next app, where every call is same-origin.
 * Ours is a separate service on a separate port, so the browser preflights and then refuses. It
 * fails as a bare "Failed to fetch" in the console with no mention of CORS, and the request never
 * leaves the browser, so the service logs nothing at all. Curl cannot see it either: curl does not
 * preflight. Only a browser reproduces this.
 *
 * The origin is ECHOED, never `*`. These requests carry the session cookie, and a wildcard is
 * invalid with credentials: the browser rejects the response rather than the request. Same rule as
 * the backend's Cors.kt, for the same reason.
