// pile and the rows are proposed; a drop with its own potential lines has its own price, so a queue
// could only guess which one went and the card names ONE row instead. See rowSales.

// boss with its difficulty, whose pool it is in, and the day it fell. Nothing else on the card
// would say which of two rings this is.
//
// Nothing here divides anything. It is LootSaleForm's boxes and the party page's own sale route, so
// a ring priced here and a ring priced on Party View are one write.
