 * Time until each cadence resets, on the server's clock.
 *
 * The instants are served (see BossClearsViewResponse.nextResets); this only counts down to them.
 * Recomputing "next Thursday" here would put a second implementation of the reset boundary in the
 * codebase, and the two silently disagreeing is exactly the failure the matrix is built to avoid.
 *
 * `onReset` fires when one of those instants passes. Reset writes nothing, so the period rolls over
 * with no request having been made and a tab left open keeps drawing last week's ticks under a
 * timer reading "now". This is the only thing on the page that knows the boundary arrived, so the
 * refetch hangs off it. Which boundary, and once per boundary: see resetToAnnounce.
 *
 * It is handed which cadences turned over, not just that something did. A weekly boundary ends the
 * week on screen and a daily one does not, and only the page can decide what to do about that.
