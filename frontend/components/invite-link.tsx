 * The link just made for one person.
 *
 * Only ever a fresh one, which is why there is a URL to show at all: the backend stores a hash, so
 * a link that was not copied is remade rather than looked up. There is no Revoke either. A link
 * expires on its own and making another deletes it, so nobody has to remember to switch one off.
 *
 * Handed a finished invite and shows it. It does not make one, so it cannot render half of
 * anything: opening on an empty box and filling it in afterwards read as a flicker. The wait for a
 * new link lives on the button that starts it. See invitePerson.
