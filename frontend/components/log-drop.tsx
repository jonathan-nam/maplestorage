// The Drop Log's own form: whose character, which boss, what fell.
//
// EVERY boss is offered. It used to list only the ones that character had no party for, on the
// grounds that a partied boss's drops belong on the party. That is where they end up either way,
// because `poolFor` resolves the character's existing config when there is one and opens a solo
// config only when there is not (see logDropRoute), so the filter never prevented a wrong row. What
// it did was hide the obvious place to record a drop behind a rule nobody could see, leaving the
// bosses you run with somebody looking absent from a list of bosses.
//
// The pool is still not asked for or sent. A boss may have no pool at all yet, and which one it is
// follows from the character and the boss.
//
// The mode is not asked for either, and is read off that same pool: the drop is going into it, so
// what it may be and how many fell are the config's own answers, the same ones the pool page gives.
// A config nobody has set a mode on narrows nothing and fills nothing.
//
// One case that resolution does not speak for itself: a RETIRED config still holds the pair's slot,
// so the drop lands in it and divides by the roster it had when it came off the lists. That is a
// party you were told you no longer run, splitting a drop with people who may not have been there,
// and it is the one thing this form has to say out loud.
