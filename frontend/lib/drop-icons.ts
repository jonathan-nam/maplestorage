 * gives: a `<link rel=preload>` for art the page has not drawn yet is warned about in the console
 * once a few seconds pass, and the click it is waiting for may never come.
 *
 * Nothing is held afterwards, which is where this differs from the seat sprites. These come from
 * our own backend, which sends `max-age=86400` on /drop-icons (see Routing.kt), so the HTTP cache
 * keeps them and the elements have nothing left to do.
