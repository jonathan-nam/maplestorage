// Naming a drop and opening its PARTY answers a different question from the one that was asked. The
// party is every drop that boss ever gave you; the row that was clicked is one of them.
//
// Three lists name a single drop: the Drop Ledger, the Settled tab, and the offsets on a Settlement
// Ledger card. All of them have to open that drop's own history. There are no component tests in
// this repo, so this reads the source, the same way ledger-css.test.ts and piece-row-guard.test.ts
// do.
//
// Whitespace is normalised first, or this fails the moment Prettier re-wraps a line.
