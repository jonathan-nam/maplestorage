// It read "paid" in a green pill, which is exactly what a status badge looks like. Undoing a share
// marked paid by mistake was not discoverable: the only obviously clickable thing said "mark paid",
// and clicking that put it straight back. Three attempts in a row ended with the row still paid, and
// the figure it was supposed to move never moved.
//
// A source test, like ledger-card-title.test.ts, because there is nothing to call: it is a literal
// in the JSX and the way it goes wrong is somebody tidying the label back to the state alone.
