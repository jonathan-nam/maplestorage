// The Collection Ledger's headline figure is what somebody is going to be ASKED for, so it is stated
// to the meso.
//
// It was shortened, and that hid a real movement: settling a 144m share took a card from 253.86b to
// 254b, which at two decimals reads as a number that did not move at all. The parts underneath were
// exact the whole time, so rounding only their sum made the one figure you act on the one figure you
// cannot check against them.
//
// A source test, like ledger-card-title.test.ts, because there is nothing to call: the choice is
// which formatter a literal in the header uses, and the way it goes wrong is somebody reaching for
// the shorter one because it fits better.
