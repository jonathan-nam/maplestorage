// Ordering a night of bosses so people stay on one character and nobody sits about.
//
// The hard part of a bossing night is not what time to meet, it is what to run and in what order.
// Every person has several characters, and each boss is run with a particular one of them. Put the
// runs in a careless order and everybody relogs between every boss.
//
// So: a run is a boss plus exactly who brings which character. A SWITCH is one person changing
// character between two consecutive runs THEY are in. Somebody sitting out a run does not log off,
// so their run for the night is a subsequence and only the gaps within it can cost anything. A
// person's first run is free, because logging in is not switching.
//
// What is optimised, in order:
//
//   1. the number of runs that fit in the time
//   2. the fullest parties first
//   3. the least waiting around
//   4. the number of switches
//   5. finishing earlier
//
// Count first is deliberate: the point of the night is dead bosses, and a plan that saves two
// relogs by dropping a boss is not obviously better. It is often not much worse either, which is
// why `byCount` hands back the best plan at EVERY length and lets the caller show the trade.
//
// The fullest parties go first because the group only shrinks: someone dropping out at midnight
// takes the six-person boss with them, where a relog costs a minute. That is why party size
// outranks switches and not the run count.
//
// WAITING is a run somebody sits out between two runs they are in. Somebody needed for two of six
// bosses should do them back to back and have the rest of the night free, whichever end that lands
// on. A run at either end costs them nothing, so only the gaps in the middle are counted. It sits
// above switches because a gap is a whole boss of sitting there and a switch is a moment at the
// login screen. It sits below party size, so a person whose two runs are the fullest and the
// emptiest can still be split across the night.
//
// A gap is counted as it OPENS, not when it closes. Waiting is only paid when somebody comes back,
// so ranking half-built nights on the paid total alone cannot tell a night that has stranded
// somebody from one that has not, and prunes the orderings that would have avoided it: that is
// what put a person's last two runs behind nine they sat out. See betterState and betterPlanned,
// which are why there are two comparators rather than one.
//
// A switch is counted and ordered on, never billed to the clock. The night is measured in whole
// runs, so at the default half hour a run the schedule reads 0:00, 0:30, 1:00. Charging a relog
// against an estimate that coarse only bought a finishing time that looked precise and was not.
//
// AVAILABILITY is a window per person, in minutes from the start of the night. `until` is hard:
// somebody with other bossing booked at the end of theirs is not going to be late for it, so a run
// that would overrun the window is never scheduled and its boss drops out of the plan. `from` makes
// the night WAIT, since a run starts at the later of the clock and everybody in it being free. That
// is the only thing that ever puts idle time in a schedule which is otherwise back to back, so a
// gap in the plan always has a person's name on it. See PlannedRun.waitingFor.
//
// Nothing here says WHOSE bosses to drop when they will not all fit. A "keep their runs" tick was
// built and taken out again: it read as a promise it could not make, and it sat next to the
// windows looking like it ordered the night, which is the thing people actually ask for and the
// thing it did not do. Say the ordering ask out loud before building for it again.
