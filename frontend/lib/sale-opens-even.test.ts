// A sale opens on an even split, whatever ratio the party's config is on.
//
// `party_member.shares` is the STACK entitlement: the party config's boxes write it, and a duo that
// cannot split three vestige stacks evenly is stored as 1:2. The sale form seeded its boxes from it,
// so that party's every ring and grindstone opened at 1:2 as well. It divides the coupon pile and
// nothing else, which is ranSeats' job.
//
// The lot side of this is pinned by lot-sale.test.ts, which can call the function. There are no
// component tests in this repo, so the form's seed is read off the source, as piece-row-guard does.
//
// One file, because there is one form: LootSaleForm is the boxes on the pool row AND the boxes on
// the Sale Ledger card that prices the same drop. A second copy is what this would stop catching.
