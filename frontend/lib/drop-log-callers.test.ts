// This is a guard against the mistake rather than the mistake: the closures were added to two call
// sites and missed on a third, twice, because each one names its arguments differently and a search
// for the exact call did not reach them. Nothing a unit test on the function itself can catch, since
// the parameter has a default and every call type-checks without it.
