// The Drop Log's tab marks, as static art.
//
// All three are the game's own item sprites, trimmed to their art and centred on a square canvas
// that the tab draws 1:1. Nothing here is ever scaled: a sprite bigger than the canvas is an error,
// not something to quietly shrink. Both ways of getting that wrong have now shipped. First a 46px
// canvas was drawn into a 23px box, which halved every mark and made the owl an unreadable 13x16px
// smudge. Then the canvas was 32 while Grindstone of Life's art is 34x33, so it was resampled 0.941x
// and went soft, which is what a fractional scale does to pixel art and is why
// pixel-scaling-css.test.ts refuses it everywhere else.
//
// The grindstone is also a catalog drop, and its id is read from catalog/drops.yaml rather than
// written twice. This file decides the SIZE, the catalog decides WHICH SPRITE.
//
//   pnpm marks

// Re-run only to change a mark or bump the dataset. The output is committed, so a normal build and
// a normal CI run never touch the network.
