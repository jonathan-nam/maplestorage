/**
 * The world mapping, and the record of how it was verified.
 *
 * Not arithmetic, so there is nothing here a reader could not check by eye. What it pins is a set
 * of CLAIMS about a live third-party API that this codebase cannot re-derive at runtime, and which
 * were expensive to obtain: Nexon returns no world name, so each row was found by looking up a
 * character whose world its owner named and seeing which numeric id answered.
 *
 * Those four names are below. If GMS merges worlds and this file starts lying, they are how to
 * re-pin it: query the ranking endpoint for each name across every id and see which answers.
 *
 *     https://www.nexon.com/api/maplestory/no-auth/ranking/v2/na
 *         ?type=world&id=<id>&page_index=1&character_name=<name>
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a live test. A unit test that hits nexon.com is a test that fails when their
 * site is slow, in a suite that gates every merge, and it would be measuring their uptime rather
 * than this mapping.
