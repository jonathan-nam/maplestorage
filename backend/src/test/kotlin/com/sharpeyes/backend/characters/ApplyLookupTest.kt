/**
 * What a refresh writes, and why the world is part of it.
 *
 * There is no longer a control for setting a character's world by hand, on the grounds that a world
 * nobody checked looks exactly like one that was: six characters in the dev database sat recorded as
 * Heroic while playing in Scania, and every screen agreed with them.
 *
 * That removal is only safe because of the first test here. If a refresh recorded what it found
 * without acting on it, a character in the wrong world would be stuck there for good, and the app
 * would have gone from a wrong answer you could fix to a wrong answer you could not.
