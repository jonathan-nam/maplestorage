/**
 * What a Heroic pool does instead of selling.
 *
 * Nothing in a Heroic world can change hands, so the whole meso ledger (the sale, the split, the
 * payout rows, the Wallet) has nothing to answer, and the pool had no product at all: the only
 * thing a drop row offered was Remove. The party still has to decide who takes each shared drop.
 *
 * So `taken_by_member_id` is the Heroic axis of `sold_at`, and these pin the three ways getting it
 * wrong would be silent: a taken drop still counted as work to do, a sale recorded as a take (which
 * loses a payout the party is owed), and a take credited to somebody who was not there.
