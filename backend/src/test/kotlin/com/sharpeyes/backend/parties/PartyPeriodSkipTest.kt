/**
 * A period the party is not running, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * The claim worth a database is that a week off costs a STANDING party nothing but the week. The
 * config, its seats and its pool all survive it, the next period runs as usual with nobody saying
 * so, and the period a mark is filed under is the BOSS's, so the Black Mage is taken off its month
 * rather than off one Thursday inside it.
 *
 * A one-off is the asymmetry: it is a night rather than an arrangement, so the same button takes the
 * night's drops with it and the config after them. Both halves are worth a database, because what
 * they turn on is a cascade and a period boundary.
