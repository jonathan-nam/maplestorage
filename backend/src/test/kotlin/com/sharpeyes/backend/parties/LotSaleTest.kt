/**
 * Selling a pile of one interchangeable drop in one go, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * What is worth a database here is that a refusal writes NOTHING. A lot spans pools, so a loop that
 * priced three rows and then hit a fourth it could not sell would commit the three, and no screen
 * would say which of them had landed. That shape is worse than a refusal, because the figures it
 * leaves all look ordinary.
 *
 * The catalog side is pinned too. Which drops may be sold this way is a decision about what those
 * drops ARE, and the flag is the only thing standing between the queue and a drop whose copies each
 * have their own price.
