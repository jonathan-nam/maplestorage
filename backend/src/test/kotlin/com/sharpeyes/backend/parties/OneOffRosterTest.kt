/**
 * A one night party, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * The claim worth a database is that a one-off's people are in the night and in no week after it.
 * Written as standing seats they were the fallback for every week nobody answered for, so a boss run
 * alone a fortnight later split with a guest who was not there and paid them. That is the failure
 * this repo exists to prevent, reached through Add Drop.
