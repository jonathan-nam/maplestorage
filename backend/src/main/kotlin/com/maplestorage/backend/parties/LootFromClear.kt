// The drops a clear implies on a boss run ALONE, and taking them back when the clear goes away.
//
// The inverse of clearFromDrop, which has read the pair the other way round since V18: something
// fell, so the boss died. This is the other end. Some drops are GUARANTEED and their amount is in
// the catalog, so clearing Extreme Kalos alone already says 180 vestige coupons landed and typing
// that in is busywork. See V37__loot_from_clear.sql.
//
// SOLO ONLY. A party's coupons are typed, with the count filled in from the config (see
// defaultQuantity in the frontend). What fell is only half of what a party needs to know: the stacks
// have to be handed out, and a row that appeared on its own is one nobody remembers agreeing to, so
// a tick corrected the next day moved money. One seat has nothing to hand out and nobody to answer
// to, which is what makes the same row a fact there rather than a guess.
//
// Only drops the catalog has an amount for. That is what makes this a fact rather than a guess: a
// drop with no amount for this boss and difficulty may or may not have fallen, and the pool would be
// claiming something nobody saw.
//
// Inside a transaction, like the rest.

/**
 * Files what this clear guarantees on a solo pool, if anything.
 *
 * Silent about everything it cannot be sure of, and each of these is a reason a pool sees nothing
 * appear rather than a wrong row:
 *
 *  - no config for the pair, so there is no pool to file into
 *  - a PARTY config, whose drops are entered by the person who was there
 *  - a RETIRED config, whose pool is history rather than a boss still being run
 *  - no difficulty recorded, so which amount applies is unknown
 *  - no amount for that boss and difficulty, which is most of them
 *  - a row already there for this period, so re-ticking a clear does not stack up three of them
