/**
 * The pool counts per config, for one week or for all time.
 *
 * A null [week] counts every drop the pool has ever held, which is what the party's own page and
 * the delete guard want. Otherwise a drop belongs to the week it fell in, so a week that has passed
 * shows the pool it had rather than today's.
 *
 * Outstanding drops are the one exception to that, and they carry FORWARD: something unsold, or
 * sold with somebody still unpaid, is work left to do rather than history, so it keeps counting in
 * every later week until it settles. Otherwise a drop from last week that still owes somebody money
 * would disappear from Party View entirely, which is the silent-omission failure this repo exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing carries backwards. A drop that fell after the week being shown is not in that week, so a
 * settled pool stays settled when you step back to it.
 *
 * "Awaiting payout" is derived the same way the loot rows derive their status: sold, and at least
 * one payout row unpaid. Deriving it in one place and storing it in none is what keeps the card's
 * badge and the drop's own status from disagreeing.
