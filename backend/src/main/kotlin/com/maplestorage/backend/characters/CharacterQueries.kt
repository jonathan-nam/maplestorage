/**
 * Writes what the ranking lookup found onto a character.
 *
 * The WORLD is the part worth reading twice. It moves with the rest, and since the per-character
 * world control is gone this is the only thing that can ever correct a wrong one: a refresh that
 * recorded the world without acting on it would leave a character stuck in the wrong world for
 * good, with nothing on any screen disagreeing with it.
 *
 * A null world leaves both columns alone rather than clearing them. That is a world this build does
 * not know, not a character that has stopped having one, and blanking it would throw away the last
 * answer anybody had.
