// Whether a config runs in one period. Held apart from PartyRoster.kt because the two answer
// different questions and are kept by different clocks: a roster is who ran in a Thursday week,
// this is whether the boss was run at all in the period the boss is answered for.
//
// A config has a default and a set of exceptions to it, and which table holds the exceptions
// depends on which default it has:
//   standing (one_off = false)   on, except the periods party_period_skip names
//   one-off  (one_off = true)    off, except the periods party_period_run names
// Either way the absence of a row is the answer, so undoing is a deletion and the next period
// reverts to the default without being told to. See V31 and V32.
//
// Inside a transaction, like the rest.

/**
 * The period a view is asking about, for a boss on this cadence.
 *
 * The live view is the period the boss is in NOW, which for a monthly boss is not the month the
 * current Thursday started in: on the first days of a month those two disagree, and answering with
 * the week's month would draw last month's mark over this one.
 *
 * A past week is that week for a weekly boss, and the month around it for a monthly one. Party View
 * drops monthly configs from a history view anyway, so that second case is a coherent answer rather
 * than one anything currently reads.
