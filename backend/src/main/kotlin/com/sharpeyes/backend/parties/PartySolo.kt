 *
 * Re-files the period this instant falls in, both ways round: it takes back only the rows it filed
 * itself and puts back what the mode it has NOW guarantees. So a mode named after the clear was
 * ticked does not leave this week's coupons missing until the reset, and Chaos corrected to Extreme
 * leaves one row of 180 rather than two.

 * roster and the split it is read with, and writing one here would edit a party through a door that
 * sees neither.
