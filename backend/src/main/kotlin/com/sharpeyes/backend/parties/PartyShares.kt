// What each seat's share was, in a given week, and what freezes it there.
//
// `party_member.shares` is a STANDING arrangement and one value, and every unsold drop's
// entitlement is derived from it on READ (see foldSeats and entitlements). So agreeing a new split
// today re-divides every outstanding drop by it, including weeks somebody has already been shown a
// figure for. Nobody is told; the number simply changes. The roster does the same one step along: a
// week with no rows of its own reads as whoever is in the party TODAY.
//
// A week may therefore name its own shares, exactly as it can already name its own roster, and on
// the same row: party_week_seat already says "this member, in this week". See V55. One insert
// carries both facts, which is why the pin lives here beside the read. They are not pinned on the
// same terms: see pinWeeksAlreadyWritten.
//
// Beside PartyRoster.kt rather than in it, because that file answers who RAN and this answers on
// what terms. Inside a transaction, like the rest.

/**
 * Freezes the roster as it stands onto every week already written into, and the shares onto every
 * one of those that is settled.
 *
 * A config is a TEMPLATE, and that is what makes an ordinary edit reach back over nights already
 * played: swap a member in August and July's outstanding coupons re-divide, and a week somebody
 * guested in is drawn with today's party. So the weeks that have been written into keep the roster
 * they read now, and a swap applies from the first week nobody has written into.
 *
 * The two part company on the period the app is CURRENTLY in. Who ran is settled by turning up;
 * what they agreed is not. Freezing the live period made the usual order of things impossible:
 * ticking Hard Limbo cleared files its 60 guaranteed coupons on its own, which pinned the default
 * split before anybody had been asked, and no per-week share exists to correct it with (the week's
 * roster has one, see PartyRoster). So the live period takes the new deal, as V55 said it would.
 *
 * Except where the money has already moved. A sale writes party_loot_payout.shares from the split in
 * force and never re-derives it, so a week holding a sold drop is frozen whether or not it is over,
 * or one night ends up showing the receipt's split and the config's at the same time.
 *
 * Run BEFORE the standing roster is written, or there is nothing left to pin.
 *
 * Nothing is pinned when [wanted] is what the party already says. The config's other fields (its
 * difficulty, its run time, who loots) do not move a week, and spelling one out for them would
 * claim it ran something other than the usual party.
 *
 * A past week that already named its own roster or its own shares keeps them: it has an answer, and
 * this is not it. A week nobody spelled out is spelled out now, at the roster it actually ran, which
 * is the same move pinWeeksAlreadyDropped makes and for the same reason.
 *
 * A LIVE week is the other way round: it is put back to the standing deal, share and all. The rule
 * has to say what every week reads and not only what it writes, or a week pinned before the rule
 * changed keeps the pin and no edit can ever reach it.
