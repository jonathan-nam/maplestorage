// which party a link means. That map is unique by construction: a name it cannot tell apart gets no
// slug, and the config falls back to its uuid rather than to whichever character was read first.

 * Rune. A doubled name takes "interactive" or "heroic" in front of it, and one doubled even then is
 * left out: absent here means the config addresses itself by uuid, which is the one answer that
 * cannot be the wrong party.
 *
 * The world's own name would read better than its category, and it is not used because nothing
 * populates characters.world_name (V26 says so). Two Runes in two Heroic worlds are what the uuid
 * fallback is for either way.
 *
 * Over every character, not the ones in the world being shown: the slug in a link has to keep
 * meaning the same party when the world lens moves.
