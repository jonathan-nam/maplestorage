 * instead, so the only thing that can overlap is a character or a person, and both of those are
 * matched by NAME, which is the match the rest of the app already runs on.
 *
 * Refusing a non-empty account was the worst screen in the app: it turned up only after the person
 * pressed the button, and it hit exactly the people keen enough to have signed up and added a
 * character before clicking the link.
 *
 * Assumes the payload's version has been checked. Returns what it did, including the configs it
 * could not, which the caller shows.
